# React Calculator

## a saturday morning project

this was a quick hacky clone of the macOS calculator app to practice 2 things: 
  - general front-end and react concepts 
  - starting and executing an idea through to completion in one sitting. 
This project was done from a great little coffee shop in north Dallas that I camped out at for the morning ([Native Coffee Co. ](http://thenativecoffeecompany.com)).

Something funny about this project is the decimal key doesnt actually work. I realized after the fact that I never implemented that behavior. Since the point of this project was to do everything in one sitting, I have to restrain my perfectionism and leave it be. Oh well!
